# Thanks and Credits

I originally developed this as part of my load testing work for [Web Performance](http://webperformance.com/). Thanks 
goes there for allowing me to open-source the work. I have several posts on the 
[Web Performance Blog](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/) related to 
[MuseIDE](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/category/museide/) and 
[load testing](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/category/load-testing/).
